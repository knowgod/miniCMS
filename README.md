miniCMS
=======

This is testint task which was given to me by &lt;site &lt;direct company.
As I have decided at the beginning to accomplish this using goot practices, I don't want this to be throw to recycle bin.

Probably this code may be useful for someone (or even for me) later.


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Create (virtual) host in you web-server.
Create new MySQL database.
Fill DB access details in the file </etc/config.php> (corresponding section should be obvious).

Open the host homepage in browser. In 1st run it will install automatially with sample data.
(For security reasons remove predefined users from DB table).
